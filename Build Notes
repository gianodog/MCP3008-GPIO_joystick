I used Rasmushauschild's 3d models to print the Portable Raspberry Pi game console case and included much of what he suggested in my build.

I didn't use all of the same parts so it took some efforts to get them all to work with the Raspberry Pi and wanted to share my experience.

For example, I didn't use a teensy and instead opting to keep the USBs all free and use GPIO for all the inputs.  The buttons were wired directly to the GPIO but I used an MCP3008 analog/digital converter chip to wire the joystick via the SPI pins on the GPIO, so I had to write a gamepad driver to achieve this.

TO DO:
Program joystick driver as a kernel module & using interrupts rather than polling (as done in my python driver) to conserve CPU resources
use https://github.com/recalbox/mk_arcade_joystick_rpi as a guide
Replace 3D printed button covers with nice buttons from SNES controller (trying http://www.ebay.com/itm/302194133526 $5.79)
Modify 3D case design to 
widen by about ~0.5 cm to accommodate 6600 mAh battery from Adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/products/353 ($29.50) 
eliminate openings on right hand side (not used in my build)
Reprint case in better resolution
Wire up LED on power switch (considering 3.3V on RPi GPIO to + and GND on RPi GPIO to -)
